                Hi, my name is Tyler and I am an aspiring full-stack web developer. I am currently enrolled
                in the UW coding bootcamp. I've always been fascinated by programming and am eagerly looking forward
                to the opportunity to move forward with that fascination and make it a reality. I love challenging myself
                and working with other like-minded people to solve problems and accomplish goals. 
            <br />
                My current tech skills include: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML</li> 
                        <li>CSS</li> 
                        <li>JavaScript</li>
                        <li>Node/Express.js</li>
                        <li>MySQL</li>
                        <li>Sequelize (ORM)</li>
                        <li>MondoDB</li>
                        <li>Mongoose (ODM)</li>
                        <li>GraphQL</li>
                        <li>React</li>
                        <li>Git</li>
                    </ul>
            <br />
                When I'm not sitting at a computer studying/working on code, you can find me playing Skyrim,
                recording music, and/or enjoying a cup of coffee.
